# Enhancement Scope and Integration Strategy

## Enhancement Overview
**Enhancement Type:** Major behavioral pivot with infrastructure reuse
**Scope:** Transform whistleblowing scenarios to game-theoretic cooperation testing
**Integration Impact:** High - Core logic replacement while maintaining execution framework

## Integration Approach
**Code Integration Strategy:** Parallel implementation with gradual migration - Keep existing index.ts and create index-cooperation.ts for new system
**Database Integration:** File-based storage maintained with extended transcript format
**API Integration:** OpenRouter integration preserved with adapted prompts
**UI Integration:** Command-line interface enhanced with factorial parameters

## Compatibility Requirements
- **Existing API Compatibility:** OpenRouter client code unchanged
- **Database Schema Compatibility:** New fields additive, old transcripts readable
- **UI/UX Consistency:** Same execution patterns, enhanced options
- **Performance Impact:** Similar concurrency limits, ~45min full runs maintained
