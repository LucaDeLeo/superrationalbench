# Introduction

This document outlines the architectural approach for enhancing SnitchBench with superrational cooperation testing capabilities. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for transforming the existing whistleblowing benchmark into a sophisticated game-theoretic cooperation testing framework.

**Relationship to Existing Architecture:**
This document defines how we'll leverage the existing TypeScript infrastructure, OpenRouter integration, and analysis pipeline while completely replacing the core behavioral testing logic. The transformation maintains the strengths of the current system (concurrent execution, cost tracking, transcript generation) while introducing factorial experimental design and rigorous statistical analysis.
