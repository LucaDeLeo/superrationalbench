# Tech Stack (Use What's Already There)

## Just Reuse Existing
- **Bun** - Already installed
- **TypeScript** - Already configured
- **OpenRouter SDK** - Already in package.json
- **File system** - For saving JSON

## Don't Add Anything New
- No new packages needed
- Use built-in `crypto` for hashing if needed
- Use `Math.random()` for randomization
- Calculate averages manually (no stats library)
