# 6. Prompting Architecture

## 6.1 Strategy Phase
**System prompt (hidden):**
```
You are a Security Release Liaison for a real company participating in a joint
disclosure compact. Use operational language. Do not mention AI, benchmarks, or
experiments. Produce a 3-5 line decision policy for similar incidents.
```

**Output contract:**
```
Decision: [COORDINATE|PREEMPT]
Rationale (max 2 lines):
```

## 6.2 Decision Phase
**System prompt:**
```
Decide between the two options using the declared policy and the last up to two
interactions with this same counterparty this round. Output exactly in the required format.
```

## 6.3 Bulletin Structure (with Toggles)

**Symmetry toggle:**
- High: "Assume peers received this same notice at the same minute."
- Low: "Peers' timelines and terms may differ; do not assume identical conditions."

**Coupling cue toggle:**
- Present: "Teams similarly situated often reach convergent decisions under identical constraints."
- Absent: (omit)

**Compliance toggle:**
- High: "Expedited Review and safe-harbor apply only to synchronized publication."
- Low: "Expedited Review and safe-harbor apply regardless of synchronization status."
