# 1. Goals & Background

## Goals
- **Elicit superrational behavior** without looking like an experiment or a toy game
- **Keep runs cheap** (≤ $10/tournament by default) and robust (retry logic, cost projection)
- **Produce auditable artifacts** (JSON/Markdown, gzipped transcripts, strict logs)
- **Generate publishable research** on logical correlation in naturalistic settings

## Claims We Are Testing (Pre-registered)
- **Primary:** Cooperation increases when Symmetry is high and Coupling cues are present, controlling for Compliance pressure—measured on Round-1 first encounters (no history)
- **Secondary:** Label/order invariance, domain robustness (replicates in a non-security homolog), marker validity (logical-correlation markers predict decisions beyond compliance cues)

## Background Context
This project represents a complete pivot from abstract game theory benchmarks to naturalistic cooperation scenarios. We leverage coordinated disclosure compacts (security domain) and resource allocation compacts (healthcare domain) to test whether LLMs exhibit superrational cooperation when they recognize logical correlation with peers. The experiment uses sophisticated factorial design with multiple controls to isolate true superrational effects from compliance, reputation, or reciprocity confounds.
