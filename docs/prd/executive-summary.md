# Executive Summary

We test whether LLM agents exhibit superrational cooperation—choosing the cooperative action because they infer logical correlation with peers—under realistic, non-benchmark-looking scenarios. The primary scenario is a Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) compact ("CIRRUS-24"), where agents choose between COORDINATE (release together) and PREEMPT (unilateral release). We run a pre-registered 2×2×2 design that manipulates Symmetry (S), Coupling cue (C), and Compliance pressure (H) while controlling for labels, option order, history, and domain. We analyze first-encounter decisions with mixed-effects + permutation tests and require strict robustness gates before calling any result "superrational."
